  Short info in the meantime:<br><br>
  Hi my name is Alex, 35 yrs old from Germany.<br>
  I am a professional Bartender and a passionate Cardanian.<br>
  Do to the Coronacrysis my BAR is shut down at the moment..<br>
  Thats why I started this stakepool to have an alternative income and to help the Network grow.<br>
    I really think Cardano can make the change that society needs to make the World a better place.<br>
    This opportunity is immense and I am really excited to take a part in it.</p>
  
  <p>
 The Setup:<br>
  I run two relay Nodes one based in Amsterdam the second in Frankfurt.<br>
  The BlockProducer Node shall stay hidden :)<br>
  Each node runs on 4GB RAM and 80GB Diskspace. <br>
    Depending on the next HFC Event I might size it up a bit. <br><br></p><p>
    So that's it for now hope to see you all soon with a way more professional webpage than this :).<br>
    Take Care stay safe and let's change the World together.
