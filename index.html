  Short info in the meantime:<br><br>
  Hi my name is Alex, 35 yrs old from Germany.<br>
  I am a professional Bartender and a passionate Cardanian.<br>
  Do to the Coronacrysis my BAR is shut down at the moment..<br>
  Thats why I started this stakepool to have an alternative income.<br><br><br><br><br>
  
  
 The Setup:<br>
  I run two relay Nodes one based in Amsterdam the second in Frankfurt.<br>
  The BlockProducer Node shall stay hidden :)<br>
  Each node runs on 4GB RAM and 80GB Diskspace. <br>
  Depending on the next HFC Event I might size it up a bit. <br><br>
    So that's it for now hope to see you all soon with a professional webpage instead.<br>
    Take Care stay safe and let's be the Change.
